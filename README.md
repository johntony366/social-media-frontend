This is the frontend for the full-stack social media website app I built.

Frontend Tech Stack:
- Next.js
- Typescript
- Chakra UI
- Redux Toolkit

Backend Tech Stack:
- Node.js
- Typescript
- Express
- MongoDB

Some things I would do given more time (and no exams):
- Add frontend validation with error messages
- Add animations with framer motion
- Implement a dark theme
- Improve the overall look and feel, maybe build on a proper design
- Give the platform a catchy name!
